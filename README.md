# 🐾 PetCast

PetCast is an iOS application that displays current weather information for a selected city and visualizes it using a virtual pet.  
The pet’s mood and appearance changes depending on weather conditions, making weather forecasting more engaging and intuitive.

## Project Concept

Instead of showing only numerical weather data, the application uses a virtual animal character to represent different weather conditions:

- Sunny weather — the pet looks happy  
- Rainy weather — the pet appears sad  
- Snowy weather — the pet remains calm  

This approach enhances user experience by combining weather data with emotional visual feedback.
